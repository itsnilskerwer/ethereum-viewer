EIPs (Ethereum Implementation Proposals) go through several stages from proposed idea to implemented change inside the Ethereum network. ERCs (Ethereum Request for Comments) are also EIPs, just with a focus on application standards, and therefore split into a different repository on Ethereums Github account.

ERC-777 for example, defines a token standard that is used in Ethereum Smart Contracts.

ALL EIPs (including all ERCs) are available at https://eips.ethereum.org
