Development of the Ethereum protocol happens through community-driven proposals, called Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). 
An EIP is a formalized design document that describes all relevant information concerning a given proposal. All EIPs are publicly available via Github at https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs. Via this repository, anyone can submit and discuss proposals. EIPs go through several stages from proposed idea to implemented change inside the Ethereum network. ERCs (Ethereum Request for Comments) are also EIPs (ones with a focus on application standards) and are split into a different repository on Ethereums Github account (ERCs).

ERC-777 for example, defines a token standard that is used in Ethereum Smart Contracts. Since ERCs are EIPs, you might see this document being referred to as EIP-777 interchangeably.

ALL EIPs (including all ERCs) are also viewable in HTML format at https://eips.ethereum.org.
