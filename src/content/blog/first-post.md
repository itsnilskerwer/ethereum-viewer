Linked Data is a term from the Semantic Web movement. The goal of Linked Data is to make data on the web machine-readable using existing web standards.

Current Web standards, like RDF (Resource Description Framework) and SPARQL (Query Language for RDF data) are used to create Linked Data.

Linked Data allows data from different sources to be easily aggregated into a single dataset, that can be queried using SPARQL.

For the presented EIP dataset, we can visualize the relationships inside the dataset (even though it is more useful to query the dataset with SPARQL). The following image has been created by pasting all triples from the EIP dataset into the tool found at the [ldf rdf-grapher](https://www.ldf.fi/service/rdf-grapher). Zoom in to see the connections.
