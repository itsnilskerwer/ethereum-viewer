RDF (Resource Description Framework) is a data model that structures data as semantic triples, or RDF triples or simply triples.

Triples are made up of subject, predicate, object ```< s, p, o . >```.

For example, if i want to say "Bob knows John" in RDF syntax, I would write: 
```http://example.name#BobSmith12 http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows http://example.name#JohnDoe34.```

Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) is a compact syntax for expressing RDF data. Therefore turtle is simply a shorthand form for writing RDF data.
